"""
Given an array of unique elements, construct a Binary Search Tree and print the sum of all the numbers formed along the path from the root node to the leaf nodes. 

Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines. First line of each test case contains N - number of nodes in the BST. The next line contains N unique integers - value of the nodes. 

Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000 
1 <= N <= 1000 
0 <= ar[i] <= 10000 

Output Format

For each test case, print the sum, separate each traversal by newline. Since the output can be very large, print output % 1000000007.
